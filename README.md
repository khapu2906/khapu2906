- 🌱 I'm known as **Indie Hacker.**

### Technology perspective
- 🙋‍♂️ I'm not a fan of **Typescript** although I still use it.
- 🌟 I'm a fan of **Java** even though I haven't used it in a while
- 👑 **PHP** is **the king of web programming languages**. Because the king doesn't need to do anything except let someone else do it.
- 🐍 **Python** should only be a language for data processing and model training. Don't use it for the web, because what we need is simple, fast, convenient, highly supported and compact.
- 🚀 **Javascript** is a convenient language for modern applications that need quick integration, but beyond that I'm not sure.
- ✨ **Rust** is the language I hope for in the future more than **Go**.
- 🤖 **AI** can replace humans if humans really want it.
